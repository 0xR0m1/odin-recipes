    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tartiflette is a dish from Savoy in the French Alps and from Aosta Valley. 
      It is made with potatoes, reblochon cheese, lardons and onions.
      A splash of white wine can be added too.
      The word "tartiflette" is probably derived from the Arpitan word for "potato" (tartiflâ) or from the Savoyard tartifles, a term also found in Provençal and Gallo-Italian. 
      This modern recipe was inspired by a traditional dish called péla: a gratin cooked in a long-handled pan called a pelagic (shovel).
      Often served as an après-ski meal, tartiflette conveys an image of Alpine authenticity and conviviality.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>1 kg de pomme de terre</li>
          <li>200 g d'oignon émincés</li>
          <li>1 reblochon bien fait</li>
          <li>2 c.à.s d'huile</li>
          <li>1 gousse d'ail</li>

          <li>poivre</li>
          <li>200 g de lardons fumés</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <ul>Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F. Add potatoes to a pot of cold water. The water should be enough to cover the potatoes. Season with salt, then bring to a boil over medium-high heat and let boil for approx. 10 - 15 min., or until fork tender. Drain and let cool.</ul>
        <ul>In the meantime, peel and mince onions and garlic. Roughly chop bacon. Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat and sauté bacon and onions for approx. 3 min. Add garlic and sauté for 2 min. more. Deglaze with white wine and let cook for approx. 2 min.</ul>
        <ul>Peel and slice cooked, cooled potatoes. Add half of the potato slices to a baking dish. Season with salt and pepper and top with half of the bacon-onion mixture. Layer over half the sliced Reblochon and repeat the process with remaining ingredients. Cover with milk and bake at 200ºC/400ºF for approx. 30 – 40 min., until the top is golden brown.</ul>
        <ul>Enjoy!</ul>
